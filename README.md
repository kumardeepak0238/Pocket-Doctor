  Summary:
      Actually what I though is that I will make such project, which is itself a doctor. Who communicate with patient who will use this pocket Dr. 
      Basically this will communicate with users and ask about their health condition, after feedback of user it will use our instruction and according 
      to them he will guide patient.
      Thatâ€™s all about our project in simple words. Inshallah we will do much better that I have described here.
